                        <p><span>EYE EXAMS:</span> Routine exams are one of the easiest things you can do to take care of your eyes. When you come to our office once a year, we can monitor your vision and keep track of any changes that could affect your eyesight. These exams are recommended for everyone - whether you're having vision problems or not - because not all eye-related ailments have noticeable symptoms. In order to ensure that your eyes are healthy, you'll need to see a doctor.</p>

                        <p><span>CHILDREN'S EXAMS:</span> It is also important for your child to have his or her eyes checked regularly. However, a child's eye exam tends to be different than an adult's exam. Children are likely to be uncooperative or become frightened during an exam because they don't understand what's happening. That's why we take special care to explain everything in terms they will understand, and we are willing to move at their pace. We make sure your child feels comfortable so we can give them the care they deserve.</p>

                        <p><span>CATARACTS:</span> A cataract occurs when the clear lens of the eye gets cloudy. Cataracts can develop in one or both of your eyes and can blur your vision, cause glare, or cause colors to appear faded. The majority of cataracts develop as you age, but there are other types including those that form after eye surgeries and injuries, those related to diabeties, those that develop before birth or during childhood, and those that can develop after exposure to certain types of radiation.</p>

                        <p><span>GLAUCOMA</span> Pressure builds up and damages the optic nerve in the eyes of those with glaucoma. This condition is known to get progressively worse as time passes and can lead to permanent total blindness in just a few years, if untreated. It is often inherited and tends to develop later in life.</p>

                        <p><span>DIABETIC RETINAL DISEASE:</span> This disease, also known as Diabetic Retinopathy, is the most common diabetic eye complication. It develops when the blood vessels in the retina change in some way. The blood vessels can leak or close off or new vessels can grow on the retina. This disease typically affects both eyes. During the early stages, most people don't recognize any changes in their vision. As the disease develops, it can cause irreversible loss of eyesight.</p>

                        <p><span>EYE INFECTIONS:</span> Infections of the eye can vary greatly. Some of the more severe symptoms can include eye pain, increased light sensitivity, or a yellow, green, bloody, or watery discharge from the eye. Infections can be worse for people with contacts. If you suspect that you may have an eye infection, take you contacts out and wear your glasses until you can see a doctor.</p>

                        <p><span>STY:</span> Often described as a small lump in or around the edge of your eyelid, stys are typically harmless. They may, however, need to be looked at by your ophthalmologist. They begin as a small lump and swell into a painful pimple. Most of the time, these external bumps will burst and heal on their own. If the cysts aren't able to drain on their own, we can treat them with an injection of medication or open them to ensure the gland is clear of infection.</p>

                        <p><span>RED EYE:</span> This term simply means that you have redness in your eye. It is advised to stay away from products that treat red eyes without seeing your ophthalmologist first. The redness could be a symptom for an underlying condition. By treating, you may be covering up a more serious issue that could lead to loss of vision and, in some cases, life.</p>

                        <p><span>BLURRED VISION:</span> This occurs when the images you see appear fuzzy or less sharp than usual. Often, blurred vision can be corrected with glasses and contacts. However, it could also be a symptom of more dangerous issues such as Diabetic Retinal Disease, Cataracts, and Glaucoma. We can gauge the severity of your blurred vision and diagnose the cause.</p>

                        <p><span>DOUBLE VISION:</span> Seeing two images is defined as having double vision or diplopia. Even though this symptom may only last for a short time, it is still important to be checked out by your ophthalmologist. Double vision can be a symptom of anything from catarcts to a brain tumor or aneurysm. By coming in for a comprehensive exam, we will be able to diagnose the cause of your double vision. From there, we will either be able to treat it or send you to a trusted specialist for a consult.</p>

                        <p><span>GROWTHS:</span> There are two common types of growths on the white of your eye. The first, pinguecula (pin-GWEK-yoo-la) appears as a yellowish lump on the white of your eye. This can be compared to a skin callus. The second growth, a pterygium (tuh-RIJ-ee-um)) is a triangle-shaped lump that can grow over the cornea. A pterygium can grow from a pinguecula and can sometimes obstruct vision. If you notice a growth forming on your eye, we can diagnose it and ensure it doesn't interfere with your vision.</p>

                        <p><span>LASER EYE SURGERY:</span> The term laser eye sergery typically refers to several different surgeris used to correct certain issues with your vision. Some laser treatments are used to treat diabetes and glaucoma. In addition, there are four other types of laser eye surgery: LASIK, PRK, LASEK, and EpiLASIK. With our top-of-the-line technology, we will be able to determine which surgery is appropriate for you.</p>
